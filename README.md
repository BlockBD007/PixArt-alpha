## üê± Abstract
<b>TL; DR: <font color="red">PixArt-Œ±</font> is a Transformer-based T2I diffusion model whose image generation quality is competitive with state-of-the-art image generators (e.g., Imagen, SDXL, and even Midjourney), and the training speed markedly surpasses existing large-scale T2I models, e.g., PixArt-Œ± only takes 10.8% of Stable Diffusion v1.5's training time (675 vs. 6,250 A100 GPU days).</b>

The most advanced text-to-image (T2I) models require significant training costs (e.g., millions of GPU hours), seriously hindering the fundamental innovation for the AIGC community while increasing CO2 emissions. This paper introduces PixArt-Œ±, a Transformer-based T2I diffusion model whose image generation quality is competitive with state-of-the-art image generators (e.g., Imagen, SDXL, and even Midjourney), reaching near-commercial application standards. Additionally, it supports high-resolution image synthesis up to 1024px resolution with low training cost. To achieve this goal, three core designs are proposed: (1) Training strategy decomposition: We devise three distinct training steps that separately optimize pixel dependency, text-image alignment, and image aesthetic quality; (2) Efficient T2I Transformer: We incorporate cross-attention modules into Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to inject text conditions and streamline the computation-intensive class-condition branch; (3) High-informative data: We emphasize the significance of concept density in text-image pairs and leverage a large Vision-Language model to auto-label dense pseudo-captions to assist text-image alignment learning. As a result, PixArt-Œ±'s training speed markedly surpasses existing large-scale T2I models, e.g., PixArt-Œ± only takes 10.8% of Stable Diffusion v1.5's training time (675 vs. 6,250 A100 GPU days), saving nearly $300,000 ($26,000 vs. $320,000) and reducing 90% CO2 emissions. Moreover, compared with a larger SOTA model, RAPHAEL, our training cost is merely 1%. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PixArt-Œ± excels in image quality, artistry, and semantic control. We hope PixArt-Œ± will provide new insights to the AIGC community and startups to accelerate building their own high-quality yet low-cost generative models from scratch.

# ‚è¨ Download Models 
All models will be automatically downloaded. You can also choose to download manually from this [url](https://huggingface.co/PixArt-alpha/PixArt).

# üíª How to Test
Inference requires at least `23GB` of GPU memory.

## Quick start with [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/guides/quickstart)

To get started, first install the required dependencies:

```bash
python scripts/interface.py --model_path path/to/model.pth --image_size=1024 --port=12345
```
Let's have a look at a simple example using the `http://your-server-ip:port`.
